Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hi my project is a brief review about my self, my professional career and interests.
There you will find 5 tabs: home, my self, interests, hobbies, dreams. In each one of theme there are photos and some text. Hyperlinks were used to move from tab to tab, also one stylesheet per tab and bootstrap for the layout.
